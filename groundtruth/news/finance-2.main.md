    ### [Tesla robotaxi: Analyst warns of 'disappointment'](/video/tesla-robotaxi-analyst-warns-disappointment-190919491.html)
    
    Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company's long-awaited robotaxi will be announced on August 8th. The news caused Tesla (TSLA) shares to bounce on Monday.  But not everyone thinks the news is a huge deal. Roth MKM Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin tells Yahoo Finance that he thinks the robotaxi will be more like a "cybertaxi." Unless Tesla starts incorporating things like lidar and more and improved cameras, Irwin thinks the robotaxi will be a "nonstarter." "I think it's going to be a disappointment," Irwin says. For a more bullish take on Tesla, check out what ARK Invest Analyst Tasha Keeney has to say.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19 points, or 0.1%, as of 2:56 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher. Much of the focus has been on interest rates and when the Federal Reserve will lower them

    Two years after clinching a historic victory at a warehouse in New York City, the first labor union for Amazon workers in the United States is divided, running out of money and fighting over an election that could determine who will lead the group in the near future. Despite campaigns at several facilities in the past few years, the warehouse on Staten Island still is the only site in the U.S. where the retail giant's workers have voted in favor of union representation.
